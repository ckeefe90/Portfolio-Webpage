      <h2>I'm an aspiring software developer in Haverhill, Massachusetts.</h2>

      <p>When I'm not working I like to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cook up some new recipes, check out <b>#keefecooking</b> on Instagram to see some things I've made!</li>
          <li>Try craft beers - if you know of any good coffee ones let me know!</li>
        </ul>
      <p><em>So far I've noticed some similarities between coding and cooking:</em></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Much like a recipe, a website can require multiple "ingredients" of code before it's complete.</li>
          <li>If you forget or change one ingredient it can completely change the final result.</li>
          <li>You can get the same end result using different ingredients.</li>
          <li>The options are endless with both recipes and coding.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p>I realized at a young age that I have a passion for both learning and teaching. It's indescribable how rewarding it feels helping others.</p>
      <p>After high school I became a Preschool Teacher for about 5 years. While I loved teaching I ended up making a career change into the office world. I spent the next 5 years working at an equipment leasing company learning everything I could about the processes and procedures for multiple departments. Before long I was creating a delinquency calendar for the collections team and creating e-mail templates for multiple departments to use, among other things.</p>
      <p>This left me wanting to know more about the technical side of things; like the most efficient way to create and deploy the templates to the teams. What goes into creating a functional application or website. How buttons are added, updated or removed. At the end of June 2020 I enrolled as a student at Thinkful for Software Engineering and started my journey to become a software engineer!</p>
